# ReadInPlateData

## A short 'n simple script to read plate reader data out of an excel file into R

Includes two different example datasets to try reading in yourself and the csv outputs that the script should give you, to compare. 

The first is PlateReaderData. This is example plate reads in the excel folder, and the csvs that the script should spit out in the csv folder. 

The second is Metadata. This is an example of what a plate key that needed to be read in with plater and merged with plate reads could look like. Again, metadata is in the excel folder, and the csvs that the script should spit out are in the csv folder.
